Pro WF:  Windows Workflow in .NET 4 - by Bruce Bukovics - Apress

** SAMPLE CODE BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS **

The following build procedure assumes that you have the following
software already installed:

 - Visual Studio 2010

Follow these steps to build all sample code for the book:

1)  If you haven't already done so, unzip all sample code
    to a new work directory.  Use the option that preserves
    the directory structure contained within the zip file.
    The assumed name for the directory is \ProWF4.  
    Once unzipped, you should see separate folders for 
    each chapter in the book.  Within each chapter, there 
    are individual folders for each project.  
    
2)  Open a Visual Studio 2010 command prompt.  This sets all 
    of the necessary environment variables needed to build
    the sample projects.

3)  Using the command prompt, change to the \ProWF4 directory
    where you unzipped the sample code.

4)  Execute the command BuildExampleCode.cmd.  This will build all
    of the solutions for all chapters of the book.
